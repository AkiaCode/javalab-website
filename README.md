## Available Scripts

### yarn start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### yarn build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" to your `snowpack.config.js` config file.

### yarn test

Launches the application test runner.
Run with the `--watch` flag (`npm test -- --watch`) to run in interactive watch mode.

### yarn serve

Serves *only* built front-end part in local with production mode via `serve`.

## Publishing to Vercel

If you want to use both serverless functions and static deploy of React application, use 'Create React App' template and override the bulid command with `npm run build`.
